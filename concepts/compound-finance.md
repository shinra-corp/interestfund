# Compound Finance

Market for Lending and Borrow cryptocurrencies without a third party.

Lenders make liquidity to market but depositing a predefine set of Tokens or Ether that Borrows can take to spend. The Borrow functionality is not relevant to this project, but as a side note, each borrow is created with a collateral that can be liquidaty if the borrow don't pay the correct amount.



To create liquidity in the market, lenders are incentivized by gaining interest. This interest is calculated with every block on the network \(approx. 15 seg per block\).  
we use this functionality to take the donors deposits \(in DAI\) and lending to Compound.
